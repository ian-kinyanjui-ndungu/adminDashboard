## File Structure
- `index.html`: Main HTML structure
- `admin.css`: All styling for the dashboard
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## Usage
Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the dashboard.

## Design Approach
This dashboard was built using CSS Grid as the primary layout method. Grid containers are nested within other grid containers to create complex layouts without the need for excessive HTML markup.

The layout starts with a top-level grid for the entire dashboard, dividing it into sidebar and main sections. The main section is further divided into header and content areas, and the content area is divided into projects and sidebar content.
